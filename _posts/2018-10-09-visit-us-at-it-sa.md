title: "Meet the OpenXPKI core team at it-sa Nuernberg"
---

The White Rabbit Security Team is presenting OpenXPKI and its companion 
projects KeyNanny and CertNanny at the it-sa it-security fair in 
Nuernberg/Germany from 9th to 11th of October. 
 
See our OpenXPKI Demo running on a Mini-PC with USB-HSM or get your personal "hands-on-experience" with clca, the incredibly easy way to manage your root certificates with a read-to-go CA environment that boots from a USB stick.

[Find us on the booth of our partner Peak Solution GmbH (10.0-420)](https://www.it-sa.de/de/ausstellerprodukte/itsa18/aussteller-40141830/white-rabbit-security-gmbh).

The rabbits are looking forward to meeting you! Contact us at <office@whiterabbitsecurity.com> to arrange your personal appointment.
