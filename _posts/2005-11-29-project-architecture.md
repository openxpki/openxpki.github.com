title: "OpenXPKI Original Architecture"
---

For reference purposes we retain the original OpenXPKI
architecture Whitepaper which was the blueprint for the very first design
of the system.

As of today OpenXPKI still adheres to most of the core design principles
outlined in this Whitepaper. Some of the original design decisions
have changed over time, such as the configuration system which has
moved away from XML.
