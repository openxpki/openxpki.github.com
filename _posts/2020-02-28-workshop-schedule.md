## Presenting Your Project

We are still looking for projects to be presented - contact us at openxpki@whiterabbitsecurity.com if you are interested.

Each talk should be about 25 to 30 minutes, explaining the overall requirement and how it was solved using OpenXPKI. We will plan another 15 minutes per talk to allow questions  so there is also room to explain or discussions some details in depth with the audience.

## Workshop

The Workshop will be mainly "Hands On" so you need to bring a laptop. We will provide VirtualBox images so all you need is a VirtualBox player. If you prefer to run your own environment we will also provide the necessary files to work on top of a community installation.
