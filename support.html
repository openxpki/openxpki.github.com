    <h1>Commercial Support</h1>

    <p>We try hard to provide useful support through the
    <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/openxpki-users">
    OpenXPKI mailing list</a> but we also understand the need to have
    a service level agreement to implement feature requests and handle
    incident tickets in a reliable manner. Commercial support is available
    from <a href="https://www.whiterabbitsecurity.com/">White Rabbit
    Security</a>, the company held by the founders and core members of
    the project.</p>

    <h2>Release Management and Software Delivery</h2>
    <p>If you need OpenXPKI packaged for your favorite operating system
    we offer the delivery of tested and signed packages, including
    custom dependencies, configuration data and scripts. Test reports and
    change log documentation to fit your SDLC process requirements can
    also be added.</p>

    <h2>Project Consulting</h2>
    <p>One of the most powerful features of OpenXPKI is the capability to
    cooperate with other systems to automate the certificate approval and
    issuance process. Our consultants have more than twenty years of
    experience in the field of certificates, key management, automation
    and data center operation. They are used to work together as a team
    in complex projects and environments for over a decade in several
    customer projects.</p>

    <p>You can leverage this experience to analyze, document and implement
    your business requirements on a per-project basis.</p>

    <h2>Incident Management</h2>
    <p>Based on an annual contract you get support with guaranteed response
    times for your PKI related incidents. This includes issues affecting
    the PKI system itself as well as engineering support (3rd level) for
    questions arising from your user base.</p>
