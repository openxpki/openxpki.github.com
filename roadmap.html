    <h1>Roadmap / Releases</h1>

    <h2>Release Cycle</h2>
    <p>We do not have an official release cycle but we plan to publish
    new releases whenever we add new functionality or in case we find any
    severe bugs.</p>

    <h2>Versioning</h2>
    <p>We follow the <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning
    guidelines</a>, so you are able to update within the 1.x branch at any
    time without touching your config.</p>

    <h2>Packaging / OS Support</h2>
    <p>Community packages are provided for free for Debian and available from our the package server. We are currently working on the upgrade to Debian Buster and a docker container.<br>
    Native packages for other distributions are available via Enterprise-Support from <a href="https://whiterabbitsecurity.com/">White Rabbit Security.</a></p>
