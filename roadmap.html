    <h1>Roadmap / Releases</h1>

    <h2>Release Cycle</h2>
    <p>We do not have an official release cycle but we plan to publish
    new releases whenever we add new functionality or in case we find any
    severe bugs.</p>

    <h2>Versioning</h2>
    <p>We follow the <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning
    guidelines</a>, so you are able to update within the 1.x branch at any
    time without touching your config.</p>

    <h2>Roadmap / Version 1.x</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>RPC API for request/renewal of certificates</li>
    <li>Enrollment over Secure Transport (RFC 7030)</li>
    <li>Dedicated renewal workflow</li>
    <li>Command line API with granular ACL</li>
    <li>Integrity protected audit log</li>
    <li>Configuration Signing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roadmap / Version 2.x</h2>
    <p>Those features are considered to require some more heavy lifting in
    the core and might break APIs, so they are scheduled for a 2.x
    release.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Enhanced Reporting and Statistics</li>
    <li>CMP/CMC support</li>
    </ul>
