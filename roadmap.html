    <h1>Roadmap / Releases</h1>

    <h2>Release Cycle</h2>
    <p>We do not have an official release cycle but in the past we 
        managed to have one new minor release per quarter and we 
        are expecting to keep this. Important security fixes or severe
        bugs will be published outside this timeline.</p>

    <h2>Versioning</h2>
    <p>We follow the <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning
    guidelines</a>, so you are able to update within the 3.x branch at any
    time without touching your config.</p>

    <h2>Packaging / OS Support</h2>
    <p>Community packages are provided for free for Debian Buster and available 
        from our the package server. There is also a docker container available,
        see the Ressources section on the main page and the <a href="https://openxpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html">quickstart manual</a> 
        for details.<br>
    Native packages for other distributions are available via Enterprise-Support from <a href="https://whiterabbitsecurity.com/">White Rabbit Security.</a></p>
