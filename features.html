<h1>OpenXPKI feature overview</h1>
This page gives an comprehensive overview on the capabilities of the OpenXPKI
trustcenter software. The goal of this information page is to provide tangible information
without getting into too much detail.</p>
<h1>OpenXPKI philosophy</h1>
<p>OpenXPKI was designed to support truly <em>continuous PKI operation</em> in <em>enterprise
environments</em>. The project is actively maintained by an experienced team
of PKI experts with a long-standing record of PKI related projects
in large enterprise environments.
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/support.html">Commercial support</a> and
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/training.html">training</a> is available.
</p>

<p>From the very beginning the original 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download/OpenXPKI-Architecture-Overview.pdf">
OpenXPKI architecture whitepaper</a> (<b>NOTE:</b> the whitepaper is
dated 2005, and the current implementation has progressed from that)
outlined the vision for an
OpenSource enterprise grade PKI software, including many features
which the developer team of OpenXPKI still considers essential for a
modern, professional PKI. Development of the project was driven and influenced by
requirements from actual customer projects.<p>

<p>OpenXPKI aims at addressing some important challenges
which impact planning and operation of a PKI. Many of the features
implemented in OpenXPKI stem from real-world requirements in
operative environments. The software contains some unique approaches
to requirements in professional environments which are not covered
by many other OpenSource (and several commercial) competitors.
</p>
<p>Instead of locally customizing the system for a particular
requirement, the OpenXPKI architecture and development team decided to
systematically approach new project requirements by technical abstraction and
generalization of the underlying business logic.
Over the time this resulted in a very powerful
architecture. OpenXPKI provides some unique approaches to addressing
frequently recurring requirements from real-world projects.</p>
  
<h1>OpenXPKI core concepts</h1>
<h2>Workflow engine</h2>
<p>The OpenXPKI core system provides a toolbox of simple, stateless
cryptographic and utility functions.</p>
<p>All complex or stateful operations are modeled as <em>Workflows</em> which
may use any of the static functions provided by the OpenXPKI core
system. Workflow complexity can range from simple one-shot operations without   
persistence (e. g. for performing reporting functions) to complex  
and long-lived workflows which can span hours or days of lifetime
(e. g. for manual certificate requests which require manual
interaction of the requester and one or more Registration Officer
approvers). Workflow instances can be interrupted and reinstantiated by users
or by the system itself.</p>
<p><img src="screenshot_request.png" alt="Certificate request submission screen"></p>
<p>OpenXPKI comes with a selection of common workflows which fit the
typical use cases of a PKI environment, e. g.</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>manual certificate request with validation and
  approval steps</li>
  <li>certificate revocation request</li>
  <li>automatic enrollment for programmatic interfaces (SCEP, EST)</li>
  <li>CRL issuance/publication</li>
  <li>reporting and statistics</li>
</ul>
  </p>
<p>The stock workflows can be modified or extended to satisfy specific
project needs, or entirely new workflows can be modeled for
implementing non-standard requirements. The stock
workflows already support most use cases the OpenXPKI team has
encountered in customer projects.</p>

<h2>Generic Web frontend</h2>
<p>Although OpenXPKI itself is implemented as a "headless" Unix daemon
process, it comes with a powerful and generic Web frontend which
allows users and administrators to work with the system. The Web
frontend allows access to the Workflow catalogue, allowing users to
instantiate new workflows and work on existing workflow workflow
instances.</p>
<p>When working with the system, the web frontend renders the current
state of the workflow according to the workflow definition and its
internal state. This means that just by defining a workflow in the
OpenXPKI configuration, a suitable Web based frontend implicitly is
available in the system.
</p>

<h2>PKI Realms: - Running multiple logical CAs in one OpenXPKI instance</h2>
<p>An OpenXPKI instance can host an arbitrary number of <em>PKI
Realms</em>. A PKI Realm manages an entire namespace of end entity
certifiates and may consist of zero, one or many Issuing CAs which can
issue certificates for this namespace.
A PKI Realm entails a set of workflows and policies for the management
of certificates. PKI Realms are completely separated from each other.
</p>

<h2>Seamless and automatic Issuing CA rollover</h2>
<p>Within a PKI Realm an arbitrary number of Issuing CAs can be
configured which issue certificates for the PKI Realm namespace.</p>
<p>When issuing a certifiate, the OpenXPKI core automatically
chooses the Issuing CA certificate (typically based on the highest NotBefore date
of all available Issuing CA certificates) and uses this certificate for
certificate issuance operations. Older Issuing CA certificates are
retained in passive mode and are only used for issuing CRLs once the
rollover to the most current CA Certificate has been performed.
(Of course, this behaviour can be overridden by explicitly
requesting a particular Issuing CA for the issuance operation.)</p>
<p>This mechanism allows for seamless and effortless CA rollovers
within a PKI Realm without any system downtime or administrative
interaction. Of course, it is also possible to administratively postpone the
rollover to a date chosen by the administrator or to execute the
rollover completely manually.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the end of an Issuing CA's certificate validity, the system automatically
issues a final long-lived CRL for the expiring CA certificate to prepare for
its retirement.</p>

<h2>Flexible and powerful configuration</h2>
<h3>File based configuration</h3>
<p>The entire OpenXPKI system is configured via a hierarchy of configuration
files in YAML format. The system configuration can be easily
managed in a revision control system such as Git. 
This approach allows to describe the system state in an auditable,
verifiable manner.</p>
<h3>Avoiding sensitive data in configuration files</h3>
<p>It is possible to exclude
sensitive information (such as database passwords) from the OpenXPKI
configuration files by using the
external tool <a href="https://github.com/certnanny/KeyNanny">KeyNanny</a> for which
native integration (via a KeyNanny Connector, see below) is provided.</p>

<h3>Connectors: accessing external data resources</h3>
<p>OpenXPKI introduces the powerful concept of a
<a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~mrscotty/Connector/lib/Connector.pm">Connector</a>.
AConnector implements an abstract key/value tuple
interface. Within the OpenXPKI configuration a Connector can be configured by specification of the
Connector implementation class and possibly additional static
parameters to be passed to the Connector implementation.</p>

<p>Based on the key passed to the Connector instance the system resolves
the implementation class and perfoms the underlying query. The
resulting value is then returned to the caller.</p>

<p>A Connector can be used instead of <em>any</em> literal
configuration value within the entire OpenXPKI configuration. The return value
of the Connector is taken as the value of the corresponding
OpenXPKI configuration value at runtime.</p>

<p>Connectors exist for querying flat files, LDAP directories, SQL
databases, Web services and more.</p>

<p>The OpenXPKI system makes extensive use of the Connector concept by providing
seamingly useless static default values in the
configuration which can be replaced by Connector calls. By doing so it
is easily possible to attach external data sources e. g. for authentication
or authorization of certificate requests.</p>

<p>Connectors are also used for writing information, e. g. publishing
of CRLs or certificates. The actual publishing code is thus completely
isolated from OpenXPKI and can be developed and tested
independently. For OpenXPKI it does not matter if a CRL shall be
published to a local file, an LDAP directory or transferred to a
remote system via scp - it's all handled via Connectors.</p>

<p>Connectors make it possible to customize and integrate OpenXPKI
with its surrounding infrastructure on a level unmatched by most
competitors.</p>

<h2>Command line driven operating</h2>
<p>OpenXPKI operation tasks are performed on the command
line. The command line tool <kbd>openxpkiadm</kbd> allows OpenXPKI
adminstrators to perform administrative tasks in textual form which
makes it possible to exactly describe the administrative tasks in
change task descriptions or scipts.</p>
<p>As an example the import of a new Issuing CA certificate can be done
online (without stoping the OpenXPKI system) using the command line tool.
If the system is configured properly, the system can automatically determine
the correct private key to use for a particular CA certificate,
including referencing the correct HSM protected key where 
applicable. This makes it entirely possible to perform an Issuing CA rollover without 
touching the configuration and allows to describe or script PKI
operation tasks in order to achieve ITIL compliant change processes.</p>

<h2>HSM support</h2>
OpenXPKI supports Hardware Security Modules for infrastructure key
protection. Most installations known
to the developers use Thales nCipher Solo or Thales nCipher Connect
HSMs. Gemalto SafeNet Network HSMs should work without problem (but
have not been tested yet).</p>
<p>Other HSMs should work via the PKCS#11 interface.</p>

<h2>Clustering support</h2>
<p>Active/passive and active/active operation of multiple OpenXPKI
instances is supported. All nodes within the cluster must share the
same configuration.</p>
<p>Active/active requires a load balancer and a shared, redundant
database. Load balancers should be configured to keep the target node
IP address constant for a client over the course of a user session.</p>

<h2>Enrollment Interfaces</h2>
<p>All OpenXPKI enrollment interfaces are very flexible and
configurable.
Where applicable they support automatic renewal based on the existing
key of the previous certificate and also allow to integration external
authentication and authorization sources via the Connector
interface.</p>
<p>Following the "zero, one or many" paradigm of OpenXPKI it is
possible to define an arbitrary number of enrollment interfaces of any
type within a PKI Realm, making it possible to supporting individual modes of enrollment for 
different enrollment client groups.</p>

<h3>SCEP enrollment interface</h3>
<p>OpenXPKI comes with a highly configurable SCEP server which is
known to work with many client implementations.</p>
<p>Fully automatic end entity certificate renewal is possible 
e. g. via <a
href="https://github.com/certnanny/CertNanny">CertNanny</a> (a client 
side certificate renewal agent using SCEP).</p>

<h3>EST enrollment interface</h3>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7030">Native support for
EST</a> is provided.
</p>

<h3>Generic RPC interface</h3>
<p>The RPC interface allows to expose any Workflow via an RPC
endpoint.
It is possible to define an arbitrary number of RPC API endpoints for
each PKI Realm which can be accessed via HTTP/HTTPS get/post requests
(depending on Web server configuration). Each RPC interface can be connected to a distinct workflow 
for RPC call processing. This allows to implement business logic via
the Workflow Engine of OpenXPKI while using the infrastructure key
protection provided by the OpenXPKI core.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>OpenXPKI includes reporting functions (implemented as one-shot
workflows) which collect statics data for a PKI Realm and creates
downloadable CSV files with the statistical data.</p>

<h1>Technical details</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Operating system:</b> OpenXPKI runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD and
  possibly others). <a href="http://packages.openxpki.org/">Packages
  for Debian and Ubuntu are available.</a></li>
  <li><b>Code base:</b>  Most of the code base is implemented in Perl5. In contrast to some other programming languages
  Perl provides a very stable programming API. PKIs are designed to
  operate for many years, and OpenXPKI benefits greatly from Perl's
  mature runtime environment and stability.</li>
  <li><b>Supported databases:</b> MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle; (PostgreSQL 
  support possible but currently outdated due to lack of customer demand)</li>
